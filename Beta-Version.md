If you're feeling brave, I also have a beta version, often with new features or code changes that needs testing.

> Please note the below commands will only work on Homebridge instances where packages are installed globally. In particular, these will **not work with HOOBS**.
### Install Beta Version
To install the beta, run the following command in your Homebridge terminal. There is no need to uninstall your current version of homebridge-deebot.
> A limitation of the beta version is that updates are not displayed in Homebridge. To update to the latest beta (or check if an update is available) simply use the same following command:
```bash
sudo npm install homebridge-deebot@beta -g
```
### Install Stable Version
To revert back to the stable version, run the following command in your Homebridge terminal.

```bash
sudo npm install homebridge-deebot@latest -g
```
### Feedback
If you experience an issue with the beta package then please create an issue on GitHub and mention that you are using the beta ðŸ˜„.
