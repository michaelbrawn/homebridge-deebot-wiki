# Setting up Custom Areas

This functionality requires the following prerequisites:

* Your device must support mapping and different areas within the ECOVACS app.
* Device Settings must be configured with Label and Device ID (`deviceId`)
  * Deebot Device ID can be found by restarting homebridge and inspecting the log line with "initialised with id" for the "did" value.

```log
[1/1/2022, 10:10:00 AM] [Deebot] [YOUR_DEVICE_NAME] initialised with id [YOUR_DEVICE_ID] additional info ...
```

* [Eve App âžš](https://www.evehome.com/en/eve-app) to initially set up.

## Obtain Spot Area IDs

The 'Spot Area IDs' are numbers which ECOVACS uses to determine a specific area on the map. These can be obtained by putting the plugin in debug mode and inspecting the logs. You should see log entries such as:

```log
[Deebot] [Device] MapSpotAreaInfo: {"mapID":"125160527","mapSpotAreaID":"13","mapSpotAreaName":"Bedroom","mapSpotAreaConnections":"12,8,","mapSpotAreaBoundaries":"875,2875;875,4825;...","mapSpotAreaSubType":"1"}.
[Deebot] [Device] MapSpotAreaInfo: {"mapID":"125160527","mapSpotAreaID":"11","mapSpotAreaName":"Kitchen","mapSpotAreaConnections":"12,1,","mapSpotAreaBoundaries":"-775,-275;-775,-175;...","mapSpotAreaSubType":"5"}.
[Deebot] [Device] MapSpotAreaInfo: {"mapID":"125160527","mapSpotAreaID":"4","mapSpotAreaName":"Hall","mapSpotAreaConnections":"9,5,","mapSpotAreaBoundaries":"4125,-2825;4125,-2725;...","mapSpotAreaSubType":"3"}.
```

In this example we have:

* Bedroom with Spot Area ID `13`
* Kitchen with Spot Area ID `11`
* Hall with Spot Area ID `4`

## Configure Spot Areas

Use these numbers in the configuration to create the areas for the plugin to use, for example:

![Example config](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43026681/126316967-acb601a6-8888-4803-ad50-e7d2c398de12.png)

Here,

* Custom Area 1 relates to the Bedroom (with Spot Area ID 13)
* Custom Area 2 relates to the Kitchen (with Spot Area ID 11)
* Custom Area 3 relates to both the Kitchen and the Hall (with Spot Area IDs 4 and 11)

## Control Using Eve App

Once the plugin has restarted (after editing the configuration), an extra button will appear within the accessory in the Eve app. You can use this to select a 'Custom Area' for the device to go to and clean. The button will show as value `0` (no area) and will revert back to `0` after a few seconds of choosing a number.

In the example on this page, setting this value to `3` would command the device to clean the Kitchen and the Hall.

You can use the Eve app to create scenes to set this value and these scenes will appear in the Home app.
