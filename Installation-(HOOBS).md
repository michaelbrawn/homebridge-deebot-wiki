### Manually

Manually installing plugins within HOOBS is very advanced. For more information please visit [the HOOBS documentation](https://support.hoobs.org/docs/5e763b63e87d1e02b6c19d2b).

## 2. Configure

A configuration screen will appear after installing the plugin where you can enter your ECOVACS credentials.

Please see the [[Configuration]] page for JSON configuration templates and other optional settings.

## 3. HOOBS Restart

After saving your configuration, HOOBS will automatically restart and voila your eWeLink devices *should* be added to your HOOBS instance.
