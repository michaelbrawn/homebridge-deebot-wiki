This functionality requires the [Eve App âžš](https://www.evehome.com/en/eve-app) to initially set up.

The plugin sets up an additional button for speed control which is only visible in the Eve App - you can then create scenes toggling this button which appear in the Home App:

![Example of button](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43026681/126310593-987cff3a-5847-4d98-9cc7-51b61f0ceb3b.jpeg)

Turning this button on will set your device to the max speed and turning it off will set your device to its normal speed.

To have access to this functionality from the Home App, you will need to create scenes within the Eve app toggling this button.

To create a Home App scene to turn the max speed ON:

* Click the 'Automation' tab at the bottom of the app and make sure you are then on the 'Scenes' tab at the top
* Click on 'Add Scene'
* Click on 'Add Actions', choose the accessory, and click on the button for 'Max Speed' and make sure the value is 'ON'
* Click on 'Add' at the top of the screen
* Click on 'Next' at the top of the screen
* Enter a name for the scene (and an icon!) and click on 'Done' at the top of the screen
* The scene should now be created and if you open the Home app the scene should be visible in the room where the device is located

To create a Home App scene to turn the max speed OFF (i.e. normal speed):

* Repeat these steps above but set the 'Max Speed' value to 'OFF'
