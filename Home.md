### Prerequisites
* To use this plugin, you will need to already have [Homebridge](https://homebridge.io) or [HOOBS](https://hoobs.org) installed. Please refer to the links for more information and installation instructions.

### Plugin Information
* This package is a much simplified version of [homebridge-deebotEcovacs](https://github.com/nicoduj/homebridge-deebotEcovacs). If you are looking for more configurable options and different cleaning modes then [homebridge-deebotEcovacs](https://github.com/nicoduj/homebridge-deebotEcovacs) will be more appropriate for you.
* This plugin uses your ECOVACS credentials to obtain and control your devices via the cloud.
* This package will expose:
  * A switch to turn auto cleaning mode on and off
  * A switch to send your device back to the charging station
  * A motion sensor to alert you if your device needs attention
  * A battery service to show the device's battery status
  * An optional humidity sensor service to show clearly the battery level percentage
